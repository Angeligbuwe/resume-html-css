## Resume Website – HTML & CSS

This is my first personal resume website built using HTML and CSS.
The project was created as part of my learning journey at ReDI School Munich to practice front-end development fundamentals.

The website presents my profile, skills, experience, and contact information in a simple and structured layout.
